### First Steps

1. Check the **Dashboard** page for system status
2. Review **Monitoring** for any active alerts
3. Try the **Predictions** page with sample data
4. Explore **Analytics** for customer insights

## Dashboard Overview

The main dashboard provides real-time visibility into your ML platform.

### System Status Cards

Four key status indicators at the top:

- **Platform Status**: Overall health (should show "healthy")
- **Model v1**: Production model status (Active/Inactive)
- **Model v2**: Candidate model status (Active/Inactive)
- **Routing Strategy**: Current deployment strategy (Shadow/Canary/Blue-Green)

🟢 **Green** = Healthy
🟡 **Yellow** = Warning
🔴 **Red** = Error

### Key Metrics

Four critical metrics displayed as cards:

1. **Total Requests**
   - Total predictions served
   - Percentage change vs last hour
   - Shows platform usage trends

2. **Model Agreement Rate**
   - How often v1 and v2 agree (in shadow mode)
   - Number of comparisons made
   - High agreement = models are similar

3. **Avg Prediction Latency**
   - Time taken to return predictions
   - Change vs baseline
   - Lower is better (target: <20ms)

4. **Model Accuracy**
   - Current model performance
   - Weekly trend
   - Target: >90%

### Charts

**Prediction Volume (Line Chart)**

### Shadow Deployment Analysis

When running in shadow mode:

- **Total Comparisons**: Number of times both models ran
- **Avg Difference**: How different predictions are

## Monitoring & Drift Detection

The monitoring page helps you detect and diagnose issues.

### Health Overview

Four cards showing:
- Model Health (overall status)
- Active Drift Alerts (number of features with drift)
- Avg Latency (request processing time)
- Prediction Accuracy (current performance)

### Drift Detection Tab

**What is Drift?**
Data drift occurs when incoming data distribution changes from training data. This degrades model performance.

**Feature Drift Chart**
- Bar chart showing p-value for each feature
- Color coding:
  - 🔴 Red (p < 0.05): Significant drift - **Action Required**
  - 🟡 Yellow (p < 0.1): Warning - **Monitor Closely**
  - 🟢 Green (p > 0.1): Normal

**Recent Drift Events Table**
- Timestamp of detection
- Feature name
- P-value (lower = more drift)
- Severity level
- Status (Drift Detected / Normal)

**Actions to Take:**
1. If red alerts appear, investigate data sources
2. Consider model retraining if multiple features drift
3. Check for upstream data pipeline changes

### Performance Metrics Tab

**Model Performance Chart**
- 24-hour view of accuracy, precision, recall
- All three should track together
- Sudden drops indicate issues

**Latency Distribution**
- Histogram showing request count by latency bucket
- Most requests should be in 5-15ms range
- Long tail indicates performance issues

**Latency Percentiles**
- P50: 50% of requests faster than this
- P95: 95% of requests faster than this
- P99: 99% of requests faster than this
- Monitor P95 and P99 for user experience

**Error Rate**
- Percentage of failed requests
- Should be < 0.1%
- Spikes indicate system issues

### Outlier Detection Tab

**What are Outliers?**
Unusual prediction requests that differ significantly from training data. May indicate:
- Data quality issues
- Adversarial inputs
- Edge cases

**Outlier Summary**
- Total requests analyzed
- Outliers detected
- Outlier rate (should be <1%)

## Model Management

Control and monitor model deployments.

### Current Deployment Strategy

Three possible strategies:

**Shadow Mode**
- v2 runs alongside v1 without affecting users
- All production traffic goes to v1
- v2 predictions compared for analysis
- **Use when**: Testing new model safely

**Canary Mode**
- Small percentage of traffic goes to v2
- Majority still uses v1
- Gradually increase v2 traffic if performing well
- **Use when**: Ready to test v2 in production

**Blue-Green Mode**
- Full switch between model versions
- Instant rollback capability
- All-or-nothing deployment
- **Use when**: Confident in v2 performance

### Model Comparison Cards

**Model v1 (Production)**
- Current production model
- Request count and traffic %
- Specifications: Random Forest, 21 features
- Historical accuracy: 89.5%

**Model v2 (Candidate)**
- New model being tested
- Request count in shadow/canary mode
- Specifications: Gradient Boosting, 21 features
- Current accuracy: 91.2%

### Shadow Analysis Metrics

**Total Comparisons**
- Number of times both models ran on same input
- More comparisons = more confidence

**Agreement Rate**
- % of times v1 and v2 agree
- High agreement (>90%) = models are similar
- Low agreement = investigate differences

**Avg Difference**
- Average absolute difference in predictions
- Should be small (<5%)

**Correlation**
- Statistical correlation between predictions
- 1.0 = perfect correlation
- >0.9 = strong correlation

**Performance Comparison**
- Visual bars showing v1 better vs v2 better
- Count of predictions where each model performed better
- If v2 better > v1 better, consider promotion
